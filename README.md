# Official Website for HackSMU
HackSMU is Southern Methodist University's annual 24-hour hackathon, an event that combines the functions of a tech conference, career fair, and start-up competition. HackSMU I (2019) and HackSMU II (2020) were collaborations between the Computer Science Club @ SMU, the SMU Computer Science Department, and the Lyle School of Engineering.

This static website, created using the `Jekyll` static site generator, is used as the main platform for HackSMU registration, information, and updates - before, during, and after the event. Edit access is given to Computer Science Club and HackSMU officers only.

## Setup and Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve`.
3. The website should be visible at `localhost:4000` in your browser. Edit as necessary in the text editor of your choice and add/commit/push to GitHub.
