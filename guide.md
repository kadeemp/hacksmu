# What is a Virtual Hackathon?
As the distributed teams model grows in popularity, bridging the virtual gap is more important than ever. Through hackathons, an event where developers and others come together to tackle problems over a short time period, distributed teams can be united under a singular purpose. The purpose is to meet new friends, learn new skills, and connect with potential employers. This holds true whether the hackathon is in person or online.

# What to Have on Hand

# How to Prepare

# Finding a Team
We will be providing a Discord channel (#teamfinding) to help facilitate team creation or you can attend the team finding session right after the opening ceremony.
In the channel, talk about your background, any languages or technical experience and that you are looking for a team. Remember that everyone is in the same boat so don’t be afraid to put yourself out there!
