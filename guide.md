# What is a Virtual Hackathon?
As the distributed teams model grows in popularity, bridging the virtual gap is more important than ever. Through hackathons, an event where developers and others come together to tackle problems over a short time period, distributed teams can be united under a singular purpose. The purpose is to meet new friends, learn new skills, and connect with potential employers. This holds true whether the hackathon is in person or online.

# What to Have on Hand
