# What is a Virtual Hackathon?
As the distributed teams model grows in popularity, bridging the virtual gap is more important than ever. Through hackathons, an event where developers and others come together to tackle problems over a short time period, distributed teams can be united under a singular purpose. The purpose is to meet new friends, learn new skills, and connect with potential employers. This holds true whether the hackathon is in person or online.

# What to Have on Hand

# How to Prepare
Read this guide completely. Make sure you go over the schedule and hop on the Discord. The Discord will be our main mode of communication, so make sure you're checking it!

Join our Discord [here](https://discord.com/invite/8QyY3nt). We’ll be using Discord for important announcements, live updates, mini event coordination, connecting with non profit orgs, and connecting you with our technical mentors. This is also a great space to chat with other hackers!

When you first join the server, check in using the #check-in channel. If you have any questions, you can reach out to event staff or mentors using The Help Desk category.

# Finding a Team
We have provided many ways for Hackers to reach out to fellow Hackers in the Hacker's HQ discord category. You can introduce yourself to fellow hackers using the #introduction channel, and showcase your interests through the #role-selection channel.

We will also be providing a channel (#teamfinding) specifically to help facilitate team creation or you can attend the team finding session right after the opening ceremony.
In the channel, talk about your background, any languages or technical experience and that you are looking for a team. Remember that everyone is in the same boat so don’t be afraid to put yourself out there!

# Opening Ceremony
